{"title": "Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2020", "publisher": "scottish-government", "description": "The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation is a relative measure of deprivation across 6,976 small areas (called data zones). If an area is identified as \u2018deprived\u2019, this can relate to people having a low income but it can also mean fewer resources or opportunities. SIMD looks at the extent to which an area is deprived across seven domains: income, employment, education, health, access to services, crime and housing.", "landingPage": "https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/", "dataURL": "https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/statistics/2020/01/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020-ranks-and-domain-ranks/documents/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020-ranks-and-domain-ranks/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020-ranks-and-domain-ranks/govscot%3Adocument/SIMD%2B2020v2%2B-%2Branks.xlsx", "datasetNotes": ["On landing page scroll down to heading \"Revision Notice\".

Data Zones have been designed to cover the whole of Scotland, nesting within council area (also known as local authority) boundaries. Data Zones are a composite geography based on aggregates of 2001 Census output areas and originally had a population of between 500 and 1,000 people per Data Zone. Where possible, they have been made to respect physical boundaries and natural communities, have a regular shape and contain households with similar social characteristics."},

It can help improve understanding about the outcomes and circumstances of people living in the most deprived areas in Scotland.

SIMD ranks data zones from most deprived (ranked 1) to least deprived (ranked 6,976). People using SIMD will often focus on the data zones below a certain rank, for example, the 5%, 10%, 15% or 20% most deprived data zones in Scotland.
