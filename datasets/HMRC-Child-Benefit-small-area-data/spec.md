### Stage 1. Spec - DM

#### Datasets: Small Area Data for Child Benefit Statistics (multiple files)

		Regional LSOA
		Electoral Ward
		East Midlands
		East of England
		London
		North East
		North West
		Scottish Data Zone
		South East
		South West
		Wales
		West Midlands
		Yorkshire and the Humber

		All can be joined together into one dataset after adjusting geography columns

		Add a 'Period' column with value taken from sheet Title. Could just put in meta data but might want to join up with previous releases at some point.
		For the two higher level datasets (Regional_LSOA & Electoral_Ward) keep the geography column 'Area Code' and remove the rest. For all the lower level area datasets keep the column 'LSOA name', rename 'Area Code' and remove other geography columns.
		'Age':
			All children = total
			Under 5 = under-5
			5 to 10 = 5-to-10
			11 to 15 = 11-to-15
			16 to 19 = 16-to-19
		'Gender':
			Boys = M
			Girls = F
			Unknown = U
		'Family Size':
			All families = total
			One child = one-child
			Two children = two-children
			Three or more children = three-or-more-children
		'Measure Type' = Count
		'Unit':
			Number of children for whom Child Benefit received = children
			Number of families in receipt of Child Benefit = families
			
		We can only output datasets with one measure and unit type at the moment so you will have to temporarily remove the families data until a solution for multiple measure datasets has been implemented. 

		Some of these Area codes are probably missing from PMD4, if so, a list of the missing Area Code URIs will have to be created in a txt file and fetch_urls.sh in gdp-vocabs repo run:
			example in terminal -> ./fetch_urls.sh < missing.txt >> vocabs/reference-geography.ttl

		Codelists needed for columns 'Age' and 'Family Size'
		info needs to be added to info.json file
		families and children need to be added to measurements-units codelist or checked to see if they already exists in an ontology
		
#### To be added to Scrapers 

		Scraper.dataset.comment = Annual geographical estimates at Lower Super Output Area and Data Zone of the number of families and children claiming Child Benefit
		Scraper.dataset.title = Child Benefit small area statistics (remove date)
		Scraper.dataset.description = Scraper.dataset.description + 
			Area codes implemented in line with GSS Coding and Naming policy
			The figures have been independently rounded to the nearest 5. This can lead to components as shown not summing totals as shown
		
#### Table Structure

		Period, Area Code, Age, Gender, Family Size, Measure Type, Unit, Value

### Stage 2. Harmonise
