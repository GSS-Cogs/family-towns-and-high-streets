                "description": "Public transport: National public transport timetable data are publically available. Data for bus, local coach and other local transport services (e.g. light rail, metro, and ferry) are captured in the Traveline National Data Set (TNDS), rail timetable data are published by the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC), and national coach services in the National Coach Data Set (NCDS). Walk: The walking network is represented by the road and urban path elements of the Integrated Transport Network produced by the Ordnance Survey. Cycle: The cycling network is represented by the road network including cycle paths and bridleways from the Integrated Transport Network. Cycle journeys are also allowed to use footpaths at walking pace. Car: The car network is represented by the road component of the Integrated Transport Network. Data on actual vehicle speeds on each road network link (generally the stretch of road between 2 nodes, or junctions) is obtained from Traffcmaster Satnav devices and are used to estimate car speeds. These data are used to calculate annual average traffc speeds on each link of the road network (by direction if the link is bi-directional). These are used as the link speeds for cars in the modelling. Where the Traffcmaster sample for an individual link is too small, national averages of the same data for the particular road type are used instead. This is an innovation from 2014. Previously the sample was too small and the model reverted to default assumptions for car speed based on road type which were much higher than the Traffcmaster averages, resulting in some inconsistency in the model."

The chosen data download options are LSOA2011 geography, date as calculation year, variable as employment status where the value is employed, and the measure chosen is a count. For the 2016 destination set, the BRES changed from 2001 census geography to 2011 census geography. The majority of LSOA boundaries are unchanged between these datasets, but some have been merged or split. Therefore the employment destination indicators are not strictly comparable between 2015 and 2016 Journey Time statistics.
